# The simplest SQL connector for non - production develop :)

## Introduction

Due to the fact that I quite often visit various contests, competitions, hackathons and project shifts, I have an urgent need for my own module for working with the database. You will ask why? In fact, everything is very simple - when you have an extremely limited time frame, then you do not have time to develop and debug "skl" queries. Yes, it's not efficient. Yes, it's not for production. BUT! With this module you can create and manage tables in a database very quickly, simply and easily. Record, modify, add, delete rows, cells, tables.
